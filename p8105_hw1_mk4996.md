### Problem 1

The dataset `early_january_weather` contains hourly meteorological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR in early January 2013.  
It has 358 rows and 15 columns.  
The important variables include:

- **time_hour**: time of measurement  
- **temp, dewp**: temperature and dewpoint in Fahrenheit  
- **humid**: relative humidity  
- **wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust**: wind direction (in degrees),
  speed and gust speed (in mph)

The mean temperature during this period was 39.5821229 °F.

### Scatterplot of temperature vs. time

``` r
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature vs Time in Early January (NYC airports)",
    x = "Time (hour)",
    y = "Temperature (°F)",
    color = "Humidity (%)"
  )
```

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot.pdf",  ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
         geom_point())
```

### Problem 2

``` r
p2_df=tibble(
x_num = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
x_logical = x_num > 0,
x_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
x_fac = factor(sample(c("low","mid","high"), 10, replace = TRUE),
        levels = c("low","mid","high"))
)

library(tidyverse)

mean(pull(p2_df, x_num))
```

    ## [1] -0.8582365

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, x_logical))   
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, x_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, x_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, x_fac))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, x_fac)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
# Error: 'mean' not meaningful for character, 'mean' not meaningful for factors
```

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, x_fac)))   
```

    ## [1] 1.8

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, x_char)))  
```

    ## Warning in mean(as.numeric(pull(p2_df, x_char))): NAs introduced by coercion

    ## [1] NA
